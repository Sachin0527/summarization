**Status:** In progress

**Summary:** An issue was identified where new users were unable to log in due to a mismatched OAuth redirect URI. 
The redirect URI was updated, but a new issue was found with the state parameter causing a '400: Invalid Request' error for some users. 
The state handling mechanism is being updated to resolve the issue.
