The history of computers is unclear, but experts believe they emerged during World War II for government use, primarily for data storage. Early computers were large and bulky. 

Computers operate on a three-step cycle: input (data entered), process (CPU calculations), and output (results displayed). This cycle is repeated for every task.

Basic computer components include the CPU, monitor, mouse, and keyboard. Additional components, like printers, scanners, and laser pens, can be connected. 


Computers come in many forms, from powerful supercomputers to everyday devices like desktops and laptops. Even mobile phones qualify as computers because they perform the fundamental functions of a computer.
