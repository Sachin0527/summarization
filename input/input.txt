- "Reviewed the ticket details and confirmed the reported issue on multiple mobile devices, including an iPhone 12, Samsung Galaxy S21, and Google Pixel 5. Observed that the slider text overlaps with the images, and the slider buttons are misaligned, making it difficult for users to navigate. Assigning this issue to myself to investigate further and determine the root cause."
- Began the initial investigation by examining the HTML and CSS files responsible for the slider's layout. Identified that the @media queries defined in the stylesheet are not appropriately targeting all device sizes. Additionally, some of the slider images are set to fixed widths instead of using responsive units (like percentages or viewport widths). Planning to refactor the CSS to ensure compatibility with different screen sizes.
- Updated the CSS to use relative units (e.g., vw and vh for widths and heights) and modified the @media queries to provide better coverage for common breakpoints (e.g., 320px, 480px, 768px, and 1024px). Applied a max-width: 100% style to the slider images to ensure they scale correctly on smaller screens. Committing these changes to the feature branch and will test on multiple devices.
- Tested the initial fix on iPhone 12 and Google Pixel 5. The images now scale properly, but the slider's navigation arrows and text are still not correctly positioned on some screen sizes. The text appears too large on smaller devices, causing overflow issues. Reopening the ticket for further adjustments.
- Reviewed the feedback from QA and noted that the slider text and navigation arrows require additional styling adjustments. Updated the CSS to include more specific @media queries for text size reduction and positioning of navigation elements. Added new classes for mobile-specific styling to handle these adjustments more gracefully without impacting the desktop layout. Committing the changes and pushing for retesting.
- Conducted cross-browser testing on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge to ensure consistent behavior across all platforms. Discovered minor discrepancies in the way each browser handles the flexbox properties used for centering the navigation arrows. Added browser-specific CSS prefixes and fallback properties to address these inconsistencies. Awaiting feedback from QA on the new changes.
- Retested the updated slider functionality across various devices and browsers. The text and navigation arrows are now correctly aligned and resized, and the overall responsiveness has improved significantly. However, there is still an issue with the transition animations on older devices (iPhone 8, Android 7). The animations appear jerky and cause slight delays in page rendering. Requesting further optimization.
- Reviewed the performance issue mentioned by QA and identified that the CSS transitions for the slider's animations were not optimized for lower-end devices. Reduced the duration of animations and changed the easing function to a more straightforward linear easing. Also, removed unnecessary CSS properties that were causing extra rendering load. Committing these changes and deploying to the test environment for further QA.
- To further enhance performance, implemented a lazy loading mechanism for slider images using the loading="lazy" attribute in HTML. This change should reduce the initial page load time on mobile devices and improve the overall user experience. Updated the browser compatibility checks to ensure this attribute works across all supported versions. Testing the impact of these changes on performance metrics and browser compatibility.
- Performance has improved significantly on all tested devices. The animations are now smooth, and the slider loads quickly without any noticeable delays. However, one final issue was identified: on some Android devices, the slider navigation arrows disappear after the second or third slide. This may be a JavaScript-related issue. Reopening the ticket for further investigation
- Investigated the issue with disappearing navigation arrows. Discovered that a JavaScript function responsible for dynamically setting the z-index of the navigation arrows was failing due to a race condition in the event listener attached to the window resize event. Refactored the JavaScript code to debounce the event listener and ensure the function executes only after the resize event has fully completed. Deployed the fix and requesting another round of QA testing
- Also added a console logging mechanism to track potential errors and warnings related to the sliderï¿½s functionality. This should help diagnose any future issues more quickly. No further changes have been made to the CSS or JavaScript beyond the debounce fix. Awaiting QA's feedback on the current state.
- Final round of testing completed across all devices and browsers, including lower-end models and legacy browsers. All issues have been resolved. The slider is now fully responsive, animations are smooth, and navigation arrows remain visible throughout the entire slide sequence. Marking the ticket as resolved, pending closure.
