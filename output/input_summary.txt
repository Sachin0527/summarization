## Global Warming: A Summary

**What is it?** Global warming is the ongoing increase in Earth's average temperature, primarily caused by human activities. Since the Industrial Revolution, the planet has warmed by over 1 degree Celsius, with the rate of warming more than doubling in recent decades.  This has led to record-breaking temperatures, with nine of the ten warmest years on record occurring since 2005.

**What causes it?**  The primary cause of global warming is the greenhouse effect, where heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide accumulate in the atmosphere, preventing heat from escaping into space.  Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels for energy, are the main contributors to these emissions.

**What are the effects?** Global warming is fueling more extreme weather events, including longer and hotter heatwaves, heavier rainfall, more intense droughts, and stronger hurricanes.  Rising sea levels are also causing coastal flooding, while melting glaciers and snowpack threaten water resources.  These effects are already causing widespread damage and death, especially impacting vulnerable communities.

**How can we address it?**  To mitigate the worst impacts of global warming, scientists urge deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and a transition to clean energy sources like wind and solar.  The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement saw global commitments to reducing emissions, but more ambitious action is needed.  Individuals can make a difference by reducing their own carbon footprint through energy conservation and lifestyle changes.

**The United States' role:** The U.S., being the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has a significant responsibility in addressing global warming.  While progress has been made on clean energy and efficiency, more action is needed to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.  Government policies and individual action are crucial to transitioning to a cleaner future.
