This is a detailed account of a bug fix process for a slider component on a website. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:

**Initial discovery and investigation:**

* **Problem:**  Slider text overlaps images and buttons are misaligned on multiple devices, hindering user navigation.
* **Root Cause:**  CSS media queries were not targeting all device sizes, and slider images used fixed widths instead of responsive units.

**Solution and testing:**

* **CSS Refactoring:**  Used relative units (vw, vh) and revised media queries for better breakpoint coverage. Applied max-width to images for responsive scaling. 
* **Initial Testing:**  Scaling worked, but text and navigation arrows still misaligned on some screens.
* **Further CSS Adjustments:**  Added more specific media queries for text size reduction, navigation positioning, and mobile-specific classes.
* **Cross-Browser Testing:**  Ensured consistent behavior across Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge by addressing flexbox inconsistencies. 

**Performance and animation optimization:**

* **Animation Issues:**  Jerky animations on older devices identified.
* **Performance Enhancements:**  Reduced animation duration, changed easing, removed unnecessary CSS properties, and implemented lazy loading for images.
* **Testing:**  Improved performance on all devices, but navigation arrows disappeared on some Android devices.

**Final bug fixes and testing:**

* **Disappearing Arrows:**  JavaScript function error due to a race condition during resize event.
* **Fix:**  Refactored the JavaScript to debounce the event listener.
* **Additional Improvements:**  Added console logging for debugging.
* **Final Testing:**  Confirmed all issues resolved on various devices and browsers, including lower-end models and legacy browsers.

**Outcome:**

The slider is now fully responsive, animations are smooth, navigation arrows remain visible, and performance is significantly improved across all devices and browsers. The ticket is marked as resolved.
